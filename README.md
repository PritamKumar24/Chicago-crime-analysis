In this project, we are going to apply Apache Spark and scikit-learn to analyze a big data set, to find valuable results behind the data. 

Crime is an inseparable part of our society. Either being a victim or an offender everybody has witnessed crime. Through this project, we will find certain trends/patterns in order to provide valuable information for the safety of society and lower crime rates. 
We have selected the “Chicago Crime dataset report” which has the incidents of crime for Chicago city that occurred from 2001 - present. 
We are going to use unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, including k-means Clustering, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression to analyze and visualize the data.
